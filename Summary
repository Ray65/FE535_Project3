Engage with the group members via a simple social activity, e.g. lunch/coffee, and send me a one a paragraph summary.
In the past students sent me a summary of what they have learned from the course or what they intend to do with the 
finals and their future plans. There is no limit on what to be discussed. I wanna make sure you keep good communication 
with each other and finalize the last project with minimum frictions. I hope this helps!

Over the long term, my goal is to collect good data, conduct careful analyses, draw accurate conclusions, and make smart decisions. 
I approach each project with my unique enthusiasm, creativity, and grit.Â 

In the short termn, I am looking to start a career in the quantitative trading industry. While I had a great experience interning as a 
Risk Engineering Strat with Goldman Sachs last summer, I am open to considering other environments in which 
to apply my quantitative research skills to difficult problems in finance. 

In an ideal role, I would be working as an integral part of an ambitious team on solving challenging problems, preferably 
leveraging cutting edge technology. I do my best work in a small team environment and I am actively looking for a team 
that would give me a lot of feedback, preferably critical and focused. From the point of view of work dynamics, I am 
looking forward to finding a team and a mentor that has high expectations and is invested in my success.
